This project implements a **Book Recommendation System** using two widely used recommendation approaches:
1. **Popularity-Based Recommendation**
2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation**

The system aims to suggest relevant books to users by leveraging user ratings and interaction patterns.

All the dataset files are stored using Git LFS due to its large size.
